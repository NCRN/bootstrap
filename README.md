# NPS Bootstrap

A version of the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) app framework customized to fit into the graphic identify of the [National Park Service](http://www.nps.gov).

All of the NPS customizations live in the <code>less</code> directory and end with <code>-nps</code>.

# Status

Work on NPS Bootstrap is just getting started, so most components have not yet been re-themed.
