# NPS Bootstrap

A version of the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) app framework customized to fit into the graphic identify of the [National Park Service](http://www.nps.gov).

This is currently pegged on v2.3.2 of Twitter Bootstrap.

All of the NPS customizations live in the <code>nps</code> directory.

# Status

Work on NPS Bootstrap is just getting started, so most components have not yet been re-themed.
